# PROJECT-Heart-Disease-Detection-using-AI
Our project aims to develop an AI-driven system for early heart disease detection. By analyzing diverse medical data—such as patient histories, lab results, and imaging studies—using advanced machine learning algorithms, the system identifies patterns indicative of cardiovascular conditions.
